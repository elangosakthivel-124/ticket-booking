  <h2>🎥 About This App</h2>
  <p>
    Elango’s Anime Movie Ticket Booking App is a sleek, single-page Angular application designed for fans of cinematic anime experiences. Built using Angular CLI 16+, Node.js 18, and styled with glowing, cinematic UI elements, the app offers a seamless and visually engaging way to browse, book, and manage anime movie tickets.
  </p>
  <p>
    The home page showcases popular anime titles like <strong>Jujutsu Kaisen 0</strong>, <strong>Your Name</strong>, and <strong>Demon Slayer: Mugen Train</strong>, each presented with vibrant posters and booking links. Users can navigate through a neon-themed navbar to access pages like Home, Ticket Booking, My Ticket, and About.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Ticket Booking page features a dynamic form where users select their movie, date, time slot, number of tickets, and seat type (Regular or Premium). Bookings are stored using a shared Angular service and persisted via <code>localStorage</code>, ensuring tickets remain visible even after page reloads.
  </p>
  <p>
    The My Ticket page displays all confirmed bookings in a glowing card layout, giving users a quick snapshot of their movie plans. The app is modular, scalable, and built with clean routing, reusable components, and responsive design principles.
